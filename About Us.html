        <p><h3>I am Julian Anthony. I was born in the Philippines, currently I am 17 Years of age as of this website's creation.</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>I like art, stories, sceneries, knowing how things work, and of course, games.</p></h3>

        <p><h3>I grew up with a bunch of exposure toward video games. A lot of my early memories were either from school or games.</h3></p>
            <br>
        <p><h3>Some of the first games I had played were Lego Star Wars and some Game Boy Advance games, bootlegs and not.</h3></p>

        <p><h3>Since then, I was always curious as to how people were able to make these games, and I found out later on that they worked as a company.</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>At some point I found out about indie games and soon after I found that they were worked on by a few people and sometimes even just one!</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>Child me was astonished at how they could possibly do this on their own, as I felt that indie games were on par in terms of quality compared to those made by companies.</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>Especially the likes of Toby Fox and Scott Cawthon who made me think that I can someday make a game myself.</h3></p>

        <p><h3>As years pass, the first time I ever encountered programming was in 7th grade where we learned basic html.</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>Then it was 10th grade, where we learned some of the C and C++ language.</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>Neither of those really piqued my interest however.</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>Here comes 12th grade where I grew as a person and before making this website, I didn't know what college course to take.</h3></p>

        <p><h3>The Empowerment Technologies subject had a project that was about making a website.</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>Teacher said it would be about anything, it just had to meet some requirements.</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>I said to myself "why not make the silliest thing I could think of at that moment"</p></h3>
            <br>
        <p><h3>The result is this website you are currently viewing right now.</h3></p>
            <br>
        <p><h3>Granted, it could be much better, but I swear I'll improve this website and refine it.</h3></p>
